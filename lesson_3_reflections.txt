When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am working on the project from different machines, when others
    are working on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because you might only be woking on a specific branch of project and not want other branches locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks reside only on the GitHub servers, and are copies of a repository from one GitHub account to another. Clones are copies of a repository; they can be both in a GitHub account and on a local machine. A Branch is another chain of commits, to follow a new purpose than the branch from which it stems. Branches can also reside on locally and on the GitHub account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	So that you have the information of those commits offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?
